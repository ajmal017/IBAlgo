Algorithmic Trading on Interactive Brokers

The package includes several modules to do algorithmic trading with Interactive Brokers API. It's based on IbPy https://github.com/blampe/IbPy, and further encapsulate independent functionality into class. It includes:

1. Download Historical Data
2. Backtest Trading Strategy
3. Run Trading Strategy on Interactive Brokers

Currently I just test it with FX, and would extend to equities in future. Since I don't have margin account due to student status, futures and options are not in my plan. Play with it for fun!
